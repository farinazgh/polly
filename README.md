# Text to Speech Chunks Processor

## Overview

This project reads a text file from the local drive, splits its content into manageable chunks of up to 3000 characters, and processes each chunk. This is useful for applications that need to handle large texts in smaller pieces, such as text-to-speech conversions with APIs that have character limits.

## Features

- Reads text from a specified file on the local drive.
- Splits the text into chunks with a maximum size of 3000 characters.
- Provides a basic example of processing text chunks.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later.
- Maven for dependency management (if using Maven).
